# Flash Loan FHE: A Private Flash Loan DeFi Protocol

Flash Loan FHE is a cutting-edge DeFi protocol that revolutionizes the world of flash loans by leveraging **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. This innovative platform allows users to execute complex arbitrage strategies with unparalleled privacy, securing their tactics from being duplicated or front-run by malicious entities like MEV bots. 

## The Pain Point: Privacy in DeFi Transactions

In the ever-competitive landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi), users often rely on flash loans for arbitrage opportunities that can yield substantial returns. However, the public nature of blockchain transactions can expose users’ strategies to others, enabling front-running attacks and information theft. As a result, many potential arbitrage opportunities remain untapped due to fears of exploitation and unfair competition. 

## The FHE Solution

Harnessing the power of **Zama's open-source libraries**, including **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, Flash Loan FHE solves the privacy challenges inherent in DeFi transactions. By encrypting users' arbitrage strategies with FHE, our protocol ensures that even during the execution of transactions, sensitive information remains secure and unintelligible to outsiders. This guarantees that users can deploy their strategies without the fear of being copied or sabotaged, thereby creating a fairer and more secure DeFi ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **Encrypted Flash Loan Arbitrage**: All strategies are protected by FHE, providing confidentiality throughout the transaction lifecycle.
- **Homomorphic Verification**: Smart contracts validate the effectiveness of the strategies without needing to decrypt them, ensuring a secure and efficient process.
- **Protection for DeFi Scientists**: Safeguards users’ alpha strategies from being exploited, fostering a more equitable environment for innovation in DeFi.
- **User-Friendly API**: Developers can easily interact with the protocol through an intuitive API, streamlining integration into their applications.

## Technology Stack

This project employs a robust technology stack to ensure optimal performance and security:
- **Zama FHE SDK**: The backbone of our confidential computing capabilities.
- **Solidity**: For smart contract development.
- **Node.js**: For server-side JavaScript execution.
- **Hardhat/Foundry**: For testing and deploying smart contracts.
- **Ganache**: A local Ethereum blockchain for development and testing.

## Installation Guide

To set up the Flash Loan FHE protocol, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will fetch all necessary libraries, including the Zama FHE SDK, ensuring your environment is ready for development.

4. Compile your smart contracts with:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

## Build & Run Guide

To compile, test, and run the Flash Loan FHE protocol, follow these commands:

1. **Compile Contracts**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests**:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy to Local Network**:

   Start a local blockchain instance if you are using Ganache, then deploy your contracts:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

4. **Execute a Flash Loan**:

   After deployment, you can execute a flash loan transaction with the following command, which will invoke your script:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/execute_flash_loan.js --network localhost
   ```

## Code Example

Here’s a simplified example of how to invoke a flash loan through our contract:

```solidity
// Flash_Loan_Fhe.sol

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./ZamaFHE.sol";

contract Flash_Loan_Fhe {
    function executeFlashLoan(address asset, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external {
        // Encrypting strategy using Zama's FHE
        bytes memory encryptedData = ZamaFHE.encrypt(data);
        
        // Call the flash loan function with encrypted data
        flashLoan(asset, amount, encryptedData);
    }

    function flashLoan(address asset, uint256 amount, bytes memory encryptedData) internal {
        // Logic to execute flash loan
    }
}
```
